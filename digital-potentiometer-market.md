<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Potentiometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Volatile</li><li>Volatile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital potentiometer market is divided into two primary types: volatile and non-volatile. Volatile digital potentiometers lose their settings once power is removed, making them suitable for applications that require dynamic adjustments without a permanent memory. In contrast, non-volatile digital potentiometers retain their settings even after power is cut, making them ideal for applications where memory retention is essential, such as in automotive and industrial control systems. Both types cater to varying needs in electronic design and control.</p></p>
