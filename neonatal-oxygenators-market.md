<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Oxygenators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hollow Fiber Oxygenators</li><li>Membrane Oxygenators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neonatal oxygenators market encompasses two primary types: hollow fiber oxygenators and membrane oxygenators. Hollow fiber oxygenators utilize a bundle of microscopic fibers to facilitate gas exchange, providing efficient oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal for newborns. Membrane oxygenators, on the other hand, use a thin membrane to allow oxygen and carbon dioxide diffusion while maintaining separation between blood and gas phases. Both types are essential for neonatal care, ensuring adequate respiratory support for vulnerable infants during critical medical procedures.</p></p>
